  <article>
  	<div class="content">
      <h3 id="this-is-my-first-post-ever">This is my first post ever.</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve been planning to launch a blog since forever mainly to document learnings, improve my writing skills and keep myself accountable. To you, my dear Internet friend, welcome!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="year-in-review">2016 year in review</h2>

<p>Before planning the future, I wanted to look back on the things I‚Äôve accomplished last year to have a good idea of where I‚Äôm currently at. Though last year was terrible <a href="//twitter.com/search?q=%232016ed">for a lot of reasons</a>, it was a great year for me over-all.</p>

<h4 id="community">Community!</h4>

<p>It‚Äôs been my second year working remotely and during my first few months, I really struggled with isolation. Last year, I became a member of two awesome communities: <a href="//upmountaineers.org">UP Mountaineers</a> and <a href="//x-team.com">X-Team</a>.
I learned a lot from these groups and also finally started to feel a sense of belongingness again. Becoming a member of these groups improved my communication, accountability, and self-confidence.</p>

<h4 id="specialization-and-career-growth">Specialization and Career Growth</h4>

<p>Working independently, my career growth is ultimately dependent on my motivation to improve myself.
Coming from being a full-stack developer, I decided to narrow my focus on UI design and front-end development: fields which I think I can deliver most value to my clients.</p>

<p>I mastered ReactJS (using it since 2014), established a design workflow using Sketch, Invision, and Zeplin, launched my new web portfolio, worked on an Electron project, and managed to make major contributions to 7 projects.</p>

<p>It was also last year that I‚Äôve established a solid work routine that works for me. This is crucial for freelancers tasked to <em>manage their own time</em>.</p>

<h4 id="travel-and-adventure">Travel and Adventure</h4>

<p>I did a <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP0t9ahizNk">four-day hike</a> with the UP mountaineers, climbed a couple of mountains after that, backpacked across Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand), and finished The North Face‚Äôs Half Trail Marathon (22 km).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bring-it-on-2017">Bring it on 2017!</h2>

<p>All the good things that I started last year, I wanted to keep consistent this year. After all, it‚Äôs all about the process, not the end-goal.</p>

<h4 id="become-more-active-in-the-community">Become more active in the community</h4>
<p>During the last quarter of last year, I became too focused on my work that I became inactive with the communities that I belong to and started to feel a lot of isolation again.</p>

<h4 id="back-to-generalization-maybe">Back to Generalization, maybe?</h4>
<p>One of my goals in the next 2 years is to be able to create a passive income stream through a digital product. I wanted to learn the technologies that enable me to rollout product ideas as quickly as possible for market testing.</p>

<p>I will still be focusing on UI design and front-end development but give a conscious effort towards learning back-end and dev ops technologies.</p>

<h4 id="more-travel">More travel</h4>
<p>My goal is to spend more time travelling than ever before but would like to prioritize local travel. The Philippines has 81 provinces with each offering a variety of culture and adventure.</p>

<h4 id="growth-through-reading">Growth through reading</h4>
<p>I find myself reading a lot (Reddit, Medium, etc) but rarely learning something that I could carry around for years.
I commit to reading at least 12 books this year and will surely share its gists on this blog. If you have any recommendations, please let me know!</p>

<p>Let this year be a year of growth and consistency. To a great year ahead! üçª</p>
