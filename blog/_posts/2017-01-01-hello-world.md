### This is my first post ever.

I've been planning to launch a blog since forever mainly to document learnings, improve my writing skills and keep myself accountable. To you, my dear Internet friend, welcome!

## 2016 year in review

Before planning the future, I wanted to look back on the things I've accomplished last year to have a good idea of where I'm currently at. Though last year was terrible [for a lot of reasons](//twitter.com/search?q=%232016ed), it was a great year for me over-all.

#### Community!

It's been my second year working remotely and during my first few months, I really struggled with isolation. Last year, I became a member of two awesome communities: [UP Mountaineers](//upmountaineers.org) and [X-Team](//x-team.com).
I learned a lot from these groups and also finally started to feel a sense of belongingness again. Becoming a member of these groups improved my communication, accountability, and self-confidence.

#### Specialization and Career Growth

Working independently, my career growth is ultimately dependent on my motivation to improve myself.
Coming from being a full-stack developer, I decided to narrow my focus on UI design and front-end development: fields which I think I can deliver most value to my clients.

I mastered ReactJS (using it since 2014), established a design workflow using Sketch, Invision, and Zeplin, launched my new web portfolio, worked on an Electron project, and managed to make major contributions to 7 projects.

It was also last year that I've established a solid work routine that works for me. This is crucial for freelancers tasked to *manage their own time*.

#### Travel and Adventure

I did a [four-day hike](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP0t9ahizNk) with the UP mountaineers, climbed a couple of mountains after that, backpacked across Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand), and finished The North Face's Half Trail Marathon (22 km).

## Bring it on 2017!

All the good things that I started last year, I wanted to keep consistent this year. After all, it's all about the process, not the end-goal.

#### Become more active in the community
During the last quarter of last year, I became too focused on my work that I became inactive with the communities that I belong to and started to feel a lot of isolation again.

#### Back to Generalization, maybe?
One of my goals in the next 2 years is to be able to create a passive income stream through a digital product. I wanted to learn the technologies that enable me to rollout product ideas as quickly as possible for market testing.

I will still be focusing on UI design and front-end development but give a conscious effort towards learning back-end and dev ops technologies.

#### More travel
My goal is to spend more time travelling than ever before but would like to prioritize local travel. The Philippines has 81 provinces with each offering a variety of culture and adventure.

#### Growth through reading
I find myself reading a lot (Reddit, Medium, etc) but rarely learning something that I could carry around for years.
I commit to reading at least 12 books this year and will surely share its gists on this blog. If you have any recommendations, please let me know!

Let this year be a year of growth and consistency. To a great year ahead! üçª
